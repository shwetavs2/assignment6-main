# Company Inventory Page

This is the Sixth Assignment of CS648 course. It is a SPA created using React, served using Express, Graphql for API integration and MongoDB as the database. A simple inventory page where one can add/delete some products and view all the products present.\
The initial setup comes from Assignment5 repo and this repo is a clone of that with new changes for Assignment 6.
